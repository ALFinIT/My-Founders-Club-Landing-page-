## 🔐 Authentication & User Management

### Auth Flow
1. **Signup:** User enters email + password → validation → created in localStorage
2. **Login:** Email + password validation → set active user
3. **Logout:** Clear user session → redirect to home
4. **Profile Setup:** After signup → role selection → form completion

### User Data Structure
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  password: string; // hashed in production
}
```

### Auth Context
- **`useAuth()` hook** - Access current user and auth functions
- **`signup(email, password, name)`** - Create new user
- **`login(email, password)`** - Authenticate user
- **`logout()`** - Clear session
- **Persistent state** - Saved to localStorage

---

#### Founder Profile
```typescript
interface FounderProfile {
  userId: string;

  company: string;
  stage: string;
  sector: string;
  location: string;
  cofounderNeeded: boolean;
  description: string;
